# Python - Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis
This repository contains the notebooks I created as part of my Data Analysis curse with CareerFoundry.

You can find the details of the project [here](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Immersion_Project_Brief.pdf).

These notebooks contain my data preparation steps, consistency checks, derivation of variables, grouping and aggregating for descriptive analysis,  and visualisations creation in order to answer the business questions set by the stakeholders.
